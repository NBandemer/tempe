Need to start the CORS server by navigating to 'cors-server' directory and running npm start (Node version 14)
Then run npm start in root directory and the web app will open.
=======
Run the cors-server before starting the app. To do this, navigate to the 'cors-server' directory and run 'npm start'.
After the cors-server successfully starts, navigate back to the root directory and run 'npm start'.
